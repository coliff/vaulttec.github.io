      <description>As mentioned in my previous post a formal description of the Isis Script DSL can be found on GitHub. An updated implementation of the Isis Script Eclipse editor is available as well.
Now the following features are support:
 Entities with injections, properties, collections, action, events and UI hints Services with injections, actions and events  This feature set allows us to implement the entity and the repository service of the domain object SimpleObject from the Apache Isis Maven archetype SimpleApp.</description>

      <description>A formal description of the Isis Script DSL is available on GitHub now. It contains all the details found in ISIS-369 and the Apache Isis mailing list.
In comparison to the formerly published alpha version of the DSL this version provides the complete feature set of Apache Isis Entities and Services:
 The simplistic actions are replaced by full-blown actions with parameters, rules and events Collections are defined now Separate events for properties, collections and actions  The concept of a dedicated service for entity repositories was dropped due to the increased complexity of the resulting DSL grammar while providing only small benefits (e.</description>

      <title>Isis Script and Maven</title>

      <description>This post answers the question from issue #5 on how to generate Java code from an Isis Script file in a Maven build.
For using Xtext-based languages in Maven builds, the Xtext project provides a dedicated Maven plugin - xtext-maven-plugin. Here a Maven user just adds the corresponding Xtext language artifact as a dependency to this plugin and defines the language-specific configuration. This configuration contains the name of the StandaloneSetup class and the output folder.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in my previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a DSL for Apache Isis. Now a first (alpha) version is finished. This version provides a very early stage of an Eclipse editor for the Isis Script DSL.
Only a few features are available yet:
 entities with injections, properties, events and repository services with injections a simplified version of action for entities and services  This feature set allows us to implement the entity and repository of the domain object SimpleObject from the Apache Isis Maven archetype SimpleApp.</description>

      <title>Starting a new project - Isis Script</title>

      <description>Recently I found some spare time to look into Sculptor issue #158. Here Dan Haywood suggested to add support for the programming model of Apache Isis.
The DSL outlined in JIRA ticket ISIS-369 shows similarities to Sculptors DSL: It has persistent entities (with properties/attributes and actions/operations) and services (actions/operations). The Isis DSL defines a model with objects which can be directly mapped to fully functional Java objects (with annotations and code blocks).</description>
